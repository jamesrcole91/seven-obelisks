##### this website
<hr class="line2">

<span style="font-family:Verdana; font-variant:small-caps; font-weight: 600; letter-spacing:3px;">SEVEN OBELISKS</span> is the personal website of James Cole, a terminally-online adult based in Central Illinois. 

In its current incarnation, it serves as a portal to my other projects and efforts.
