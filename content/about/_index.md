SEVEN OBELISKS is the personal website of James Cole.

It exists as a collection of curios, personal projects, and links to content I find interesting, compelling, or thought-provoking.

This is a digital creative space, to be endlessly tinkered on. Apologies for any broken content you might stumble upon.

*Please stay as long as you'd like.*
