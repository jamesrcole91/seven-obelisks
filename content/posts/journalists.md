One of the left's critiques of the modern media landscape is its obsessive search for a "fair and balanced" viewpoint. Journalists are quick to present every story as a disagreement between two valid viewpoints, of equal moral standing.

It's why we see endless stories where conservatives are painted as meerly ideologically different from liberals, instead of Neo-Feudalists and vicious idealogues. 

Their policy positions, devoid of any logic or common sense, are simply distractions from the ongoing class warfare they enact against the empoverished working class. But according to the American media ecosystem, their legacy is only made up of the sanitized, corporate-friendly terminology that completely ignores the damage they inflict on society and the financial interests that corrupt their viewpoints.

The [*Times'*](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/21/us/omaha-streetcars.html) recent piece on Warren Buffett's objections to developing a streetcar in downtown Omaha is an excellent example of the whitewashing that news giants routinely perform. 

Buffett, through his company Berkshire Hathaway, owns a significant [stake in Geico](https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-geico-51663013589), one of America's largest insurance companies. The automotive industry has long been one of the biggest opponents to alternative forms of transportation, effectivelly killing off streetcars across the country.

Recent efforts to disrupt America's car-centric economy are an existential threat to companies that profit so heavily off of our car-dependent country. Of course Buffett is against such a bold symbol of Big Automotive's shrinking equity amongst the general public.

You know who won't point that out though? The *Times*.
