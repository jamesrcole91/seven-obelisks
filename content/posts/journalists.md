There's a bittersweet joy about launching a project site. 

On the one hand, I get to see the fruit of my labor and pride myself in learning something new. On the other, it's an entirely new committment. Like much of life and the endeavours we take on, it'll be an opportunity to navigate the waters of both pride and dissapointment.

I'm not going to hold myself to any posting cadence. Whever inspiration strikes, hopefully I'll be near my computer. I tend to overwhelm myself with expectations, and I don't want to do that this time.

At some point, I'll likely get very frustrated with this whole thing and want to give up. That's my brain telling me to step back and take a break. It's easy to overwhelm ourselves when we're passionate about what we're doing.

An important reminder to my future self: **it's supposed to be fun!**
