##### Wet, but not wild

My neighbor brought me bittersweet news the other day. He's selling his home and moving to Tennessee with his family. Like many, he'd grown sick of the long, dark, and frigid Midwest winter. He pines for the brisk weather of the South. 

I don't blame him. Even this most mild of winters is enough to drive us all mad, drinking and smoking until we're in a hazy cloud of our discontent. 

I've found myself staring out the window, only to be thoroughly dissapointed at the sight of yet more dark clouds. The thunder seems to stretch forever. And while I fully appreciate the importance of testing the tornado sirens, I can't imagine it helps any of our psyches.

##### February Finds

[The U.S. Army in the Iraq War: Volume 2](https://digitalcommons.usmalibrary.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&context=books)

The entire series is a tome - an excruciating look at the Iraq war and the failure of American policy to create a stable regime after deposing Saddam.

[Takashi Ito's *Ghost*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv3OG05nDSY)

A haunting short film. Also of note is his work *Thunder.*

["Do you ever yearn?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnqBAuehmhM)

I've been watching Seinfeld recently. This is probably my 50th re-watch, and yet every time I find something I didn't fully appreciate at first glance.
