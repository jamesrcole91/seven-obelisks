##### on life
<hr class="line2">

- To be alive is to suffer. We have much to learn from how we suffer.
- The atoms that comprise your body once "belonged" to another. You have lived many lives, and will live many more - even if you don't remember them.
- Even if we discovered our purpose, we would not understand it.
- There is a special joy in moderation and temperance.

##### on death
<hr class="line2">

- Mortality is fundamental to the human experience. To be alive, you must die.
- Many people spend their whole lives hiding from their death, refusing to acknowledge its inevitability. To be spiritually free, you must look deep into the heart of your own demise and find peace with it. Only then will your death be a noble one.

##### on religion
<hr class="line2">

- There is nothing wrong with spirituality. The issue with religion is its organization and desire for control.
- Believe what you want, and don't concern yourself with what others think or believe.
- You can join any religion you want. Your beliefs don't need to be validated by an instutition, and anybody who says otherwise just wants to assert power over you.

##### on progress
<hr class="line2">

- Progress for the sake of progress isn't inherently good.
- Technology's success is only judged by its ability to bring us physical pleasure, not spiritual fulfilment.
- Our history as a species is the story of enslavement. We enslave each other, nature, and often ourselves. 

##### on modernity
<hr class="line2">

- We are approaching the end of history.
- Money is the root of all evil. Its allure has driven many mad. Avoid its corrupting influence.
- Everything is art. Nothing is art.
- You should be constantly striving to consume less. There's no satisfaction [at the end of the rainbow](https://thubtenchodron.org/2007/08/wisdom-satisfaction/).
