<p>My neighbor brought me bittersweet news the other day. He&rsquo;s selling his home and moving to Tennessee with his family. Like many, he&rsquo;d grown sick of the long, dark, and frigid Midwest winter. He pines for the brisk weather of the South.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame him. Even this most mild of winters is enough to drive us all mad, drinking and smoking until we&rsquo;re in a hazy cloud of our discontent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found myself staring out the window, only to be thoroughly dissapointed at the sight of yet more dark clouds. The thunder seems to stretch forever. And while I fully appreciate the importance of testing the tornado sirens, I can&rsquo;t imagine it helps any of our psyches.</p>

<p><a href="https://digitalcommons.usmalibrary.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&amp;context=books">The U.S. Army in the Iraq War: Volume 2</a></p>
<p>The entire series is a tome - an excruciating look at the Iraq war and the failure of American policy to create a stable regime after deposing Saddam.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv3OG05nDSY">Takashi Ito&rsquo;s <em>Ghost</em></a></p>
<p>A haunting short film. Also of note is his work <em>Thunder.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching Seinfeld recently. This is probably my 50th re-watch, and yet every time I find something I didn&rsquo;t fully appreciate at first glance.</p>
