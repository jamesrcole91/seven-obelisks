      <description>One of the left&amp;rsquo;s critiques of the modern media landscape is its obsessive search for a &amp;ldquo;fair and balanced&amp;rdquo; viewpoint. Journalists are quick to present every story as a disagreement between two valid viewpoints, of equal moral standing.
It&amp;rsquo;s why we see endless stories where conservatives are painted as meerly ideologically different from liberals, instead of Neo-Feudalists and vicious idealogues.
Their policy positions, devoid of any logic or common sense, are simply distractions from the ongoing class warfare they enact against the empoverished working class.</description>
