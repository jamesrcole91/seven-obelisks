      <description>Wet, but not wild My neighbor brought me bittersweet news the other day. He&amp;rsquo;s selling his home and moving to Tennessee with his family. Like many, he&amp;rsquo;d grown sick of the long, dark, and frigid Midwest winter. He pines for the brisk weather of the South.
I don&amp;rsquo;t blame him. Even this most mild of winters is enough to drive us all mad, drinking and smoking until we&amp;rsquo;re in a hazy cloud of our discontent.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a bittersweet joy about launching a project site.
On the one hand, I get to see the fruit of my labor and enjoy the process of learning something new. On the other, it&amp;rsquo;s an entirely new committment. Like much of life and the endeavours we take on, it&amp;rsquo;ll be an opportunity to navigate the waters of both pride and dissapointment.
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to hold myself to any posting cadence.</description>
