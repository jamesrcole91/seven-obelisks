      <description>SEVEN OBELISKS is the personal website of James Cole.
It exists as a collection of curios, personal projects, and links to content I find interesting, compelling, or thought-provoking.
This is a digital creative space, to be endlessly tinkered on. Apologies for any broken content you might stumble upon.
Please stay as long as you&amp;rsquo;d like.
technical specs This site is built with Hugo, and hosted on Cloudflare Pages. It is designed to be as lite and accessible as possible, taking inspiration from the 1MB Club.</description>
